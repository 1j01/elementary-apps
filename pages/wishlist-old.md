As many excellent apps you will find here, as many people probably miss their personal favorite. This is just a little collection of elementary applications that are either waiting to be revived, only live in the form of mockups or even only in the heads of wishful thinkers. 

If you are developer one of these wishes might be a good place to start your own elementary project.

Name | Generic | Developer
---|---|---
Lingo | Dictionary App | Abandoned official elementary application
Dexter | Dictionary App | Abandoned official elementary application
*unnamed* | Office Suite | Often asked for in discussion, but as pointed out by some this is probably an undertaking as big as the whole elementary project. [Writer](http://quassy.github.io/elementary-apps/Writer/) is the only current app that could be part of this, a spreadsheet and presentation app only exist as mockups so far.
